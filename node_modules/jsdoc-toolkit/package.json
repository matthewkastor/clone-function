It is written in JavaScript and is run\nfrom a command line (or terminal) using the Node.JS JavaScript runtime\nengine.\n\nUsing this tool you can automatically turn JavaDoc-like comments in\nyour JavaScript source code into published output files, such as HTML\nor XML.\n\nFor more information, to report a bug, or to browse the technical\ndocumentation for this tool please visit the official JsDoc Toolkit\nproject homepage at http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/\n\nFor the most up-to-date documentation on JsDoc Toolkit see the \nofficial wiki at http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/w/list\n\n======================================================================\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n\nNode.JS interpreter http://nodejs.org\n\n======================================================================\n\nINSTALLATION:\n\n`npm install jsdoc-toolkit`\n\nor, you can install it globally and have it available for all your projects.\n\n`npm install jsdoc-toolkit -g`\n\nMake sure to add your global `node_modules/.bin` directory to your path for\nconvenient access to your global packages from the command line.\n\n======================================================================\n\nUSAGE:\n\nFrom Scripts:\n\nThis module exports jsdoctoolkit, it has a run method that accepts a single\nargument: an array of strings corresponding to the exact command line arguments\nyou would use, in the same order as you would give them on the command line.\n\n```\nvar jsdocToolkit = require('jsdoc-toolkit').jsdoctoolkit;\n\njsdocToolkit.run(['--help']);\n```\n\n```\nvar jsdocToolkit = require('jsdoc-toolkit').jsdoctoolkit;\nvar argz = [\n    \"-d=./docs/\",  // output directory for documentation.\n    \"-o=./jsdoc-toolkit-log.txt\" // file for logging messages like warnings.\n    \"cli.js\" // the file or directory to generate documentation for.\n];\njsdocToolkit.run(argz);\n```\n\nCommand line:\n\nGiven a file named mycode.js that you want documented:\n\nif you've installed this package globally it's as easy as running\n\n`jsdoc-toolkit -a mycode.js`\n\nIf you have installed jsdoc-toolkit into your package instead, from the package\nroot run\n\n`node_modules/.bin/jsdoc-toolkit -a mycode.js`\n\nIn both cases the output documentation files will be saved to a new directory\nnamed \"out\" (by default) in the current directory, or if you specify a\n`-d=somewhere_else` option, to the somewhere_else directory.\n\nFor help (usage notes) enter this on the command line:\n\n`jsdoc-toolkit --help`\n\nMore information about the various command line options used by JsDoc\nToolkit are available on the project wiki.\n\n======================================================================\n\nTESTING:\n\nTo run the suite of unit tests included with JsDoc Toolkit enter this\non the command line:\n\nnpm test\n\nTo see a dump of the internal data structure that JsDoc Toolkit has\nbuilt from your source files use this command:\n\njsdoc-toolkit mycode.js -Z\n\n======================================================================\n\nLICENSE:\n\nJSDoc.pm\n\nThis project is based on the JSDoc.pm tool, created by Michael\nMathews and Gabriel Reid.
